<h1 id="his">HISTORY OF TROJAN HORSE</h1>



<div id="content1"><p>
Almost 3000 years ago, the Trojans and Greeks fought a long and terrible war. 
Why? Because the Trojans had captured a beautiful Greek princess Helen. But this is
a story about a horse and not the princess; The Greeks fought a battle with Troy
but could not get in the tall strong walls around the city. They tried everything 
but it began to look that Greeks would not win the battle.

So the Greeks thought that if they could not win the battle with their physical 
strength then they should win it with their brains. They thought of a smart trick. 
They started building a wooden horse. The Trojans kept wondering why the Greeks were 
building a horse. Some laughed and some were puzzled.
 Then one day when they saw the greek armies sailing away, they got confused. Soon 
 in few days, all the warships, army tents and armies disappeared. 
 The only thing that remained were the 80 ft tall strange wooden horse.
</p>
</div>




<div id="content2"><p>
Some Trojan wanted to burn the horse but the King was too proud of defeating Greeks and ordered to 
bring the horse inside the city walls as a symbol of their victory. After pulling the horse inside they 
partied and danced all night. Then they went to sleep.It was now that the Greeks played the rest of their
trick. Not all the Greeks had sailed away on the warships. A very brave Greek soldier named Odysseus
had chosen some tough fighting men to hide inside the hollow wooden horse. Around thirty soldiers 
stepped out in the dark and signaled their warships that had been hiding around a nearby island.
Then they opened the Trojan city gates and the Greek army swarmed in.

The Greeks caught the Trojans completely off guard. After a fierce battle 
 they took princess Helen back to Greece.

<div id="fun-time">

<p class="funfacts-lists">
We know about the Trojan War because of ancient writers. These writers wrote 
about the war hundreds of years after it was supposed to have taken place. The most 
important of these writers were the poets Homer and Virgil.
</p>

<p class="funfacts-lists">
The Trojan war lasted 10 years
</p>

<p class="funfacts-lists">
The Trojan horse is a historic tale from the Trojan War.
Yes believe me it was Odysseus who came up with the idea Trojan horse and
made it so historically convincing that I myself  actually happen to believed 
it really happen. <div id="learn2"><a href="#">Learn more... &#x2192;</a></div>
</p>
 
<p class="funfacts-lists" id="specific-pos">
In modern times the term Trojan Horse has been used to talk about computer programs 
that on the outside seem to be a good program but really it is a damaging computer virus,
spyware, or other type of malware. Like the mythical Trojan Horse, these computer programs 
seem to be gifts but once they get past your computer's defenses they open up and wreak 
havoc on your machine. So when you see a program on the Internet that seems too good to be 
true, watch out! - it could be a Trojan Horse

<div id="finish" >
<p class="funfacts-lists">
To convert all this in just a few sentences, wily Odysseus comes up with a sneaky plan. Most of the Greeks
will pretend to sail away, while a few hide inside of a giant wooden horse. Despite the arguments of the
priest Laocoon and the seer Cassandra, the Trojans drag the horse inside the city thanks to the lies
of a Greek named Sinon.<br><br>That night, Odysseus and the rest of the Greeks inside the horse sneak out,
open the gates for their buddies, and finally lay waste to the city of Troy.
If you ask this was a one way plan with high probability of feiler
 I mean imagine if one of the accidently 
made noise or someone decide to check in the horse since they were clearly trap doors
visible on the wooden horse.
